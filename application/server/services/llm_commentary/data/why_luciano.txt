Hey everyone, welcome to Volleyball Pro Mindset, where we analyze professional volleyball players and teams and react to exciting pro volleyball games. I'm Coach Donnie and I'm a semi-professional volleyball player, sports performance trainer, and volleyball coach.
In this video, I'll be analyzing Luciano DeCecco, who is one of the most creative and best setters in the world. DeCecco was born in 1988 and is 6'4 or 193 centimeters, 194 pounds or 88 kilograms. He plays for the Argentine men's national team, winning the bronze medal at the Tokyo 2020 Olympic Games. He currently plays professionally for Cucine Lube Civitanova in Italy.
Now, let's dive into five reasons why Luciano DeCecco is a true artist of volleyball:
1. He's one of the most creative setters in terms of running his middles at any time, from any location, with his hands or his platform. This is especially stressful for the opposing middle blocker because they have to stay with the middle even on a poor pass because Luciano doesn't just do the simple quick set in front of him with his hands. He can also do the bump set short quick in front of him, as well as the bump set shoot or longer distance quick set in reverse.
2. He's always thinking one step ahead of his opponents by creatively faking them out and changing his decision at the last second after the opponent goes for the fake. He'll also look to see what you're doing first and improvise on the go based on what the blockers are doing, completely catching them off guard.
3. Luciano has amazing one-handed setting control. Every setter at the professional level can set decently with one hand, but it's usually more of an emergency move that has minimal strategy and they're just trying to save the ball and make it somewhat hittable. But DeCecco has just as much control with one hand as he does with two hands and is decisively making competitive setting decisions to the optimal hitter and location with one hand. Look at his incredible wrist control where he is able to manage the right height, speed, and location with just his hand. It truly is like watching an artist at work.
4. Luciano keeps his hitters in rhythm up to 20 feet off the net or even 30 feet away. Setting at the same rhythm is more than just setting to the same location from different positions on the court. It's more about allowing your hitters to accelerate to the ball at the same speed no matter where the setter is setting from. And DeCecco does this by changing the speed of the set based on where he's setting from. When he is closer to the hitter, he slows down the speed of the ball so he doesn't rush the hitter. When he is further away from the hitter, he speeds up the ball so his hitter doesn't have to wait and can still approach to the ball at maximum velocity. Managing different speeds to the same location is truly an art form that DeCecco has mastered.
5. Luciano can set to any hitter regardless of where he is facing, which makes him very difficult to read. Most setters usually square up to the outside hitter location regardless of where the pass is because it's much easier to gauge how far off the net you are and it's also difficult for the blockers to read when you're always facing the same position every time you set. That's what we consider more of a traditional setting technique. But Luciano takes that deception to a whole new level by facing any direction and still managing to set at the proper height, speed, and location, which is very difficult to do as a setter because you have no single point of reference that you can use to gauge how far off the net you are. This means he hasincredible court spatial awareness where he knows exactly where his hitters are and what speed they're approaching without being able to see them or use the net as a point of reference. It's as if he has eyes on the back of his head and on each side of his head.
   Also, when it comes to reading setters as a blocker, when a setter like Luciano is facing a different direction every single time, it's very difficult to track his setting patterns because every set looks different, which makes them even more frustrating to read and defend against.
   The last and most important quality that empowers him to do all the previously listed skills in this video is his calm demeanor. Not only does this allow him to be a mentally and emotionally steady leader for his teammates on the court, but this also allows him to be an excellent strategist to make split-second decisions with very high accuracy. And that's impossible to do if you're mentally and emotionally up and down throughout the game.
   When you're running around the court and transitioning from defense to offense as a setter, it can become very hectic because you're always setting from a different location, receiving the pass from different heights, and having to set from difficult body positions. So in order to make good setting decisions with optimal control in those hectic situations, you have to be extremely calm and controlled, since setting is more about technique and flow than it is about power and strength.
   Luciano is a true tactician where he not only knows where each hitter is at all times, he also knows exactly what his blockers are doing at all times. And like I said, he's got eyes all over his head.
